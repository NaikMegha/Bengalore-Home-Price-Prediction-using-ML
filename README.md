The proposed system built a model using scikit-learn and linear regression using Bangalore home price dataset. During model building it covered most of the ML concepts such as data load and cleaning , outlier detection and removal , feature engineering , dimensionality reduction , GridSearchCV for hyper-parameter tuning, k fold cross validation etc.

Technology and tools:
Python, 
NumPy and pandas for data cleaning, 
Matplotlib for data visualization, 
scikit-learn for model building, 
Jupyter notebook and PyCharm as IDE,
Python flask for http server, 
HTML/CSS/JS for UI.
